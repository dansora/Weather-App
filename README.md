# Weather App

## Weather App that use free weather API's

I have build this weather app that uses free api's from (openweathermap.org).

## Technologies used

I used HTML for the main page of the app.
CSS was used for styling the look of the app.
Bootstrap was use as a general framework for the display of the app.
JavaScript was used as the main tech to run this app.
Vite was installed to generate the app.

## Usage
I created a weather dashboard with form inputs.
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
- The city name
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
- The wind speed
When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
